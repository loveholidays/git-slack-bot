# git-slack-bot

git-slack-bot automatically posts your GitHub pull request messages to a Slack channel of your choosing. It listens to GitHub events via a webhook and can post new PRs, react with emojis to signify merges and approvals, and post review comments under the original Slack post in a thread.

## Features

- üîî **Automated PR notifications** - Get notified when PRs are opened, merged, or closed
- üí¨ **Threaded comments** - PR review comments appear as threaded replies in Slack
- üòÄ **Emoji reactions** - Visual indicators for PR approvals, merges, and closures
- üë• **Team member mapping** - Maps GitHub users to Slack users for proper @mentions
- üéØ **Selective notifications** - Configure which users and events to track
- üîí **Secure webhooks** - Validates GitHub webhook signatures for security

### Example Configuration

```yaml
github:
  token: "ghp_your_github_token_here"
  secretKey: "your_webhook_secret_here"
  org: "your-github-org"
  team: "your-team-name"
  ignoredPRUsers: ["dependabot[bot]", "renovate[bot]"]
  ignoredCommentUsers: ["github-actions[bot]"]

slack:
  token: "xoxb-your-slack-bot-token-here"
  channelID: "C1234567890"
  githubEmailToSlackEmail:
    - githubEmail: "john.doe"
      slackEmail: "john.doe@company.com"
    - githubEmail: "jane.smith"
      slackEmail: "jane.smith@company.com"
  emoji:
    approve: "white_check_mark"
    merge: "merged"
    close: "x"
```

## Prerequisites

Before setting up git-slack-bot, you'll need:

### GitHub App Setup
- A GitHub App with the following permissions:
  - **Repository permissions**:
    - Pull requests: Read & Write
    - Issues: Read & Write
    - Metadata: Read
    - Contents: Read
  - **Organization permissions**:
    - Members: Read (to access team information)
  - **Subscribe to events**:
    - Pull request
    - Pull request review
    - Pull request review comment

### Slack App Setup
- A Slack App with the following OAuth scopes:
  - `chat:write` - Post messages to channels
  - `chat:write.public` - Post to public channels without joining
  - `reactions:write` - Add emoji reactions
  - `channels:read` - List public channels (optional, for channel name resolution)

### Infrastructure
- A publicly accessible endpoint for webhook delivery
- Docker runtime or Go environment for deployment

## Detailed Configuration
- `github`:  
  - `token`: The security token of the github app, which will send events through a webhook
  - `secretKey`: The secret key of the github webhook to verify incoming events against
  - `org`: The github organization the team is in
  - `team`: The team which has the members to post PR for
  - `ignoredPRUsers`: Users in the github team to ignore opened PRs for. Their comments will still show up in threads.
  - `ignoredCommentUsers`: Users to ignore PR comments from. Recommended to add any automated github app account
- `slack`:
  - `token`: The security token of the slack app, which will send messages to a slack channel
  - `channelID`: The slack channel id to post the PR messages to
  - `githubEmailToSlackEmail`: Mapping between github and slack users. Needed to be able to use `@mention`s for the
correct user. Any missing users will be posted with their github user names into the slack channel
    - `githubEmail`: The github **USERNAME** of a team member
    - `slackEmail`: The slack email of the same team member
  - `emoji`:
    - `approve`: The emoji to use as a reaction when a PR is approved
    - `merge`: The emoji to use as a reaction when a PR is merged
    - `close`: The emoji to use as a reaction when a PR is closed

## Usage Examples

### Basic Webhook Setup

1. **Set your webhook URL** in your GitHub App settings:
   ```
   https://your-domain.com/webhook
   ```

2. **Configure webhook events** to send:
   - Pull requests
   - Pull request reviews
   - Pull request review comments

3. **Set webhook secret** (must match `secretKey` in config)

### Environment Variables

You can also configure the bot using environment variables:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"
export GITHUB_SECRET_KEY="your_webhook_secret"
export SLACK_TOKEN="xoxb-your_slack_token"
export SLACK_CHANNEL_ID="C1234567890"
```

### Testing Your Setup

1. **Health Check**: Visit `http://your-deployment:8080/health` to verify the service is running
2. **Test Webhook**: Create a test PR to verify webhook delivery and Slack posting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Bot not receiving webhooks
- ‚úÖ Check that your webhook URL is publicly accessible
- ‚úÖ Verify the webhook secret matches your configuration
- ‚úÖ Ensure your GitHub App has the correct permissions
- ‚úÖ Check GitHub's webhook delivery logs for errors

#### Messages not appearing in Slack
- ‚úÖ Verify your Slack bot token has the required permissions
- ‚úÖ Check that the channel ID is correct (should start with 'C')
- ‚úÖ Ensure the bot is invited to private channels
- ‚úÖ Review application logs for authentication errors

#### User mentions not working
- ‚úÖ Verify `githubEmailToSlackEmail` mapping is correct
- ‚úÖ Use GitHub **usernames** (not emails) in the mapping
- ‚úÖ Use actual Slack **email addresses** in the mapping
- ‚úÖ Check that mapped users exist in both GitHub and Slack

#### Emoji reactions not working
- ‚úÖ Ensure emoji names are valid Slack emoji codes (without colons)
- ‚úÖ Verify the bot has `reactions:write` permission
- ‚úÖ Check that custom emojis exist in your Slack workspace

### Debug Mode

Run with debug logging to troubleshoot issues:

```bash
# Docker
docker run -e LOG_LEVEL=debug ghcr.io/loveholidays/git-slack-bot:latest

# Binary
LOG_LEVEL=debug ./git-slack-bot --config config.yaml
```
